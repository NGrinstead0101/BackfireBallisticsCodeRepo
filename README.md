# BackfireBallisticsCodeRepo

Hello, my name is Nick Grinstead! Backfire Ballistics is a 2D physics-oriented platforming game where the player's main means of movement is launching themselves through the air with the recoil of a shotgun. While I primarily worked on the design of this project, I also contributed to programming. This repository holds the scripts from Backfire Ballistics that I contributed a significant amount of code to as a means of showcasing that work. Some of these scripts have multiple authors so be sure to check the comments to know who wrote what.
